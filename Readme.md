  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/componentjs/component.png)](https://travis-ci.org/componentjs/component)

  Component is a vertically integrated frontend solution, handling everything from package management to the build process, handling everything including HTML, JS, CSS, images, and fonts. Think of it as an opinionated `npm + browserify + rework-npm + grunt/gulp/broccoli` all wrapped into `component build`.

> **New release**: We'll release component 1.0.0 soon!

> **Please note**: As of 1 April 2014, component v1.0.0 release candidates have been pushed to master. Several
major new features have been added, some have been removed, and the project has been greatly reorganized. You may need to upgrade your
version of node and/or npm to avoid breakage. Please see the detailed [changelog](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/changelogs/1.0.0.md) in the
[Guide](https://github.com/componentjs/guide) repo.

## Installation

  First, you need [node](http://nodejs.org) v0.10+ installed. If you do not have it installed, visit [node's download page](http://nodejs.org/download/).

  With [node](http://nodejs.org) installed, run the following command:

     $ npm install -g component

## Getting Started

Read this [Getting Started](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/component/getting-started.md) guide to get a basic static site running very quickly with Component.

For questions and more information about Component, please visit the [guide](https://github.com/componentjs/guide) repository.

Note: the Component repo (this repo) has only documentation for Component 0.19. All of the documentation related to 1.0.0 will be handled in the [guide repo](https://github.com/componentjs/guide).

## Team

The team and organization have undergone massive changes. In summary, [jonathanong](https://github.com/jonathanong) stopped developing Component and started with [normalize.io](https://normalize.github.io/) and the guys from [segmentio](https://github.com/segmentio) switched to using [duo](http://duojs.org). Component will still be maintained and updated while it is in use.

The long story of Component and the changes that occurred in component can be found in Jonathan Ong's blog post ["the future of component"](http://www.jongleberry.com/the-future-of-component.html).
