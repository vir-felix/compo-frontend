Newcomers should use [Duo](https://github.com/duojs/duo) instead of this implementation. Duo is more feature-complete and adds additional goodies while still supporting component.json, so check it out!

  Component is a vertically integrated frontend solution, handling everything from package management to the build process, handling everything including HTML, JS, CSS, images, and fonts. Think of it as an opinionated `npm + browserify + rework-npm + grunt/gulp/broccoli` all wrapped into `component build`.
