  Component is a vertically integrated frontend solution, handling everything from package management to the build process, handling everything including HTML, JS, CSS, images, and fonts. Think of it as an opinionated `npm + browserify + rework-npm + grunt/gulp/broccoli` all wrapped into `component build`.
